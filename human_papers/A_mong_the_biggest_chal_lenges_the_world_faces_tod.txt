A
mong the biggest chal-
lenges the world faces 
today are the climate 
crisis and the broader 
issues of environmental 
sustainability raised in books such 
as Jared Diamond’s Collapse: How 
Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed 
(Viking, 2004). Part of the solution 
to this problem depends on climate 
science, breakthrough technologies, 
and policy changes. 
However, as Daniel Quinn argued 
in his 2002 address, “The New 
Renaissance” (http://ishmael.org/
Education/Writings/The_New_ 
Renaissance.shtml), “What we 
must have (and nothing less) is a 
whole world full of people with 
changed minds. Scientists with 
changed minds, industrialists with 
changed minds, school teachers 
with changed minds, politicians 
with changed minds.” He goes on 
to describe how each of us must find 
a more sustainable way to do things 
in businesses and at home. 
A commonly stated goal is to 
reduce world energy use to 1990 
levels, thereby stabilizing atmo-
spheric CO2 emissions at 350 parts 
per million (J. Hansen et al., “Target 
Atmospheric CO2: Where Should 
Humanity Aim?” 18 June 2008, 
http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1126v2, 
http://350.org). 
Computer scientists can help reach 
this goal in four ways. Two of these 
involve mitigating the direct negative 
impact of computers—their power 
consumption as well as the economic 
and social costs associated with the 
manufacturing, maintenance, and 
disposal of components. The other 
two relate to the indirect positive 
impact of computers—their abil-
ity to increase energy efficiency by 
changing systems and ways of being; 
to potentially reduce world emissions 
by as much as 15 percent by 2020,

important scientific questions.

Energy consumption 
A Forrester Research report proj-
ects the number of personal com-
puters in use in the most populous 
countries to double to 2.25 billion by 
2015 (S. Yates, “Ranking PC Growth 
Markets,” 10 July 2007). Embedded 
devices are becoming pervasive; by 
2011, there will be three per person 
on the planet (www.microarch.org/
micro35/keynote/Agerwala.pdf).
According to the Climate Group, 
total energy consumption by com-
puters—including the power con-
sumption and embodied energy 
of data centers, PCs and peripher-
als, and networks and devices—
accounted for 830 million metric 
tons of carbon dioxide, or 2 percent 
of the total world carbon footprint, 
in 2007. As Figure 1 shows, these 
figures are roughly equivalent to the 
total CO2 emissions of Nigeria, Iran, 
and Poland, respectively. Data cen-
ters alone use almost 0.5 percent of 
the world’s energy, and this figure is 
likely to quadruple by 2020.
Lowering the energy cost of com-
putation will depend on our ability 
to reduce processor cycles, communi-
cation needs, and architectural inef-
ficiencies. For example, according 
to the US Environmental Protection 
Agency, power adaptors consume 11 
percent of US electricity, yet available 
design changes soon to be mandated 
by the Energy Star program (www.
energystar.gov) can reduce their 
energy use by 30 percent. 
Hardware
Hardware advances provide new 
opportunities for compile-time or 
dynamic efficiency improvement. 
For example, heterogeneous chip 
multiprocessors can achieve four to 
six times energy savings per instruc-
tion (R. Kumar et al. “Heteroge-
neous Chip Multiprocessors,” Com-
puter, Nov. 2005, pp. 32-38).

Recent research by Samuel Wil-
liams and colleagues explores 
supercomputing programming 
paradigms for a modified Cell pro-
cessor that can achieve up to 100 
times the energy efficiency of lead-
ing competitors (“The Potential 
of the Cell Processor for Scientific 
Computing,” Proc. 3rd Conf. Com-
puting Frontiers, ACM Press, 2006, 
pp. 9-20). 
Networks
Smarter networking can likewise 
reduce communication costs. For 
example, intelligent routing proto-
cols can ensure the use of minimum 
energy routes, and media access 
control (MAC) protocols can reduce 
energy consumption in idle times 
during data transmission and recep-
tion (C. Sengul and R. Kravets, 
“Heuristic Approaches to Energy-
Efficient Network Design Problem,” 
Proc. 27th Int’l Conf. Distributed 
Computing Systems, IEEE CS Press, 
2007, p. 44). 
Although much of the original 
work in energy-aware communi-
cation comes from the wireless 
domain, researchers have lever-
aged these techniques in the wired 
domain. Protocols such as Adaptive 
Link Rate use machine learning to 
lower desktop computers’ energy 
consumption by reducing Ethernet 
transmission rates when utilization 
is low (P. Patel-Predd, “Energy-Effi-
cient Ethernet,” IEEE Spectrum, 
May 2008, p. 13). 
Data centers
Server-based systems that support 
many different remote individuals 
require a different set of power-man-
agement strategies. For example, 
Ripal Nathuji and Karstan Schwan 
tackle the problem through virtu-
alization (“VirtualPower: Coordi-
nated Power Management in Vir-
tualized Enterprise Systems,” Proc. 
21st ACM SIGOPS Symp. Operat-
ing Systems Principles, ACM Press, 
2007, pp. 265-278). 
Although managing energy in a 
data center might seem to be only 
a matter of scale, researchers at 
HP Labs have shown that it is also 
necessary to consider the machines’ 
thermal properties (R. Raghavendra 
et al., “No ‘Power’ Struggles: Coor-
dinated Multi-Level Power Man-
agement for the Data Center,” ACM 
SIGARCH Computer Architecture 
News, Mar. 2008, pp. 48-49). 
Luiz André Barroso and Urs 
Hölzle argue that machines should 
consume energy in proportion to 
the amount of work performed 
(“The Case for Energy-Propor-
tional Computing,” Computer, 
Dec. 2007, pp. 33-37). However, 
achieving this goal in large data 
centers could significantly affect 
performance.
A recent Microsoft Request for 
Proposal highlights additional 
research needed to create power-
aware systems (http://research.
microsoft.com/ur/us/fundingopps/
rfps/PowerAware_RFP.aspx). This 
includes benchmarks and metrics, 
integration and cooperation across 
system layers, advances in scientific 
computing and visualization, and 
innovations in everything from the 
physical layout of data centers to 
the structure of the average com-
puter—for example, substituting 
flash memory for other types of 
memory.
electronic waste
Almost as daunting as computing 
devices’ growing energy consump-
tion are the high costs associated 
with their production, support, 
upgrading, and retirement. Beyond 
the numerous resources used in the 
product life cycle—including water, 
fuel, and electricity—is the difficult-
to-measure but often devastating 
impact computer-related waste has 
on human populations and the envi-
ronment. 
A recent Basel Action Network 
report (“The Digital Dump: Export-
ing Re-use and Abuse to Africa,” 
24 Oct. 2005, www.ban.org/ 
BANreports/10-24-05/documents/
TheDigitalDump.pdf) predicts that 
the US alone will retire approxi-
mately 3 billion units of electron-
ics—primarily computers, moni-
tors, and TVs—by 2010. Companies 
dump much of this refuse in develop-
ing countries, exposing millions of 
people to dangerous toxins such as 
Figure 1. Carbon dioxide emissions from the energy consumed by data centers, PCs and 
peripherals, and networks and devices are roughly equivalent to those of Nigeria, Iran, 
and Poland and account for 2 percent of the total world carbon footprint.

energy embodied in the devices. 
Computer scientists can influence 
many steps in the computing life 
cycle (E. Blevis, “Sustainable Inter-
action Design: Invention & Disposal, 
Renewal & Reuse,” Proc. SIGCHI 
Conf. Human Factors in Computing 
Systems, ACM Press, 2007, pp. 503-
512). For example, one step toward 
eliminating electronic waste is reduc-
ing the need for new computers. 
Innovative desktop grid comput-
ing projects such as the Berkeley 
Open Infrastructure for Network 
Computing (http://boinc.berkeley.
edu), which grew out of SETI@
home’s efforts to search for extra-
terrestrial intelligence, can help with 
this. Virtualization, which allows 
many users to share one computer, 
also can help. 
Incorporating modular chips or 
components makes it possible to 
replace a single part instead of an 
entire system. More radically, as 
networks become ubiquitous, we 
can create personal devices that 
are simple clients, shifting the more 
intensive computation to upgrade-
able servers and thereby reducing 
the need to replace every individual 
device. 
However, this approach raises 
tradeoffs between personal privacy 
and control over data that research-
ers need to address. It also creates 
new challenges for designers: Can 
one device fit all needs? If not, what 
is the best way to distribute data over 
multiple devices?  
global energy 
consumption 
The Climate Group’s recent report 
argues that computing technology 
could facilitate significant reductions 
in worldwide energy use, equalling 
as much as five times the projected 
growth in computational power 
consumption. Energy savings could 
be accomplished through recent or 
future innovation in motor systems, 
transport and storage logistics, 
power grids, and building design, 
management, and automation.  
Computers’ interactive nature 
provides an additional opportunity 
for energy reduction—by educating 
people, creating new ways of being, 
and changing behavior. For example, 
Columbia University’s Educational 
Global Climate Modeling software 
(http://edgcm.columbia.edu) enables 
high school and college students to 
visualize climate change at home 
and in the classroom. This is possible 
because today’s personal computers 
can run older climate models.
In 2006, Chicago’s Center for 
Neighborhood Technology (www.
cnt.org) helped reduce summer elec-
tricity usage by 3 to 4 percent by pro-
viding local households an ambient 
orb, shown in Figure 2, that displays 
the real-time cost of energy. 
Cutting home energy use is one of 
the major ways in which individuals 
can shrink their carbon footprint. 
Even small changes can collectively 
have a large impact such as avoiding 
the need for a new power plant.
Wildly popular social-network-
ing websites such as Facebook pro-
vide yet another lever to modify the 
energy-consumption habits of poten-
tially millions of people (J. Mankoff 
et al., “Leveraging Social Networks 
to Motivate Individuals to Reduce 
Their Ecological Footprints,” Proc. 
40th Ann. Hawaii Int’l Conf. Sys-
tem Sciences, IEEE CS Press, 2007, 
p. 87). StepGreen.org is one Web 2.0 
application exploring these ideas.

Discovery and Innovation initiative 
(www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.
jsp?cntn_id=108366) highlights the 
increased interest among research-
ers in applying innovations in com-
putational thinking to all types of 
science, including climate science. 
For example, recent advances in 
scientific computation are making 
it possible to better understand the 
impact of forest dynamics on car-
bon sequestration (D. Purves and S. 
Pacala, “Predictive Models of Forest 
Dynamics,” Science, 13 June 2008, 
pp. 1452-1453).  
The Earth System Grid (www.
earthsystemgrid.org), a new proj-
ect sponsored by the US Depart-
ment of Energy’s Scientific Discov-
ery through Advanced Computing 
program (www.scidac.gov), is an 
example of a grid computing solu-
tion for managing access to and stor-
ing petabytes of data generated by 
such climate models.
Little data is available at the micro 
level about energy consumption, air 
and water quality, and other environ-
mental issues. However, as Figure 3 
shows, emerging sensor-rich mobile 
computing devices make it possible 
for “citizen scientists” to capture 
fine-grained data on a large scale 
(E. Paulos, R.J. Honicky, and E. 
Goodman, “Sensing Atmosphere,” 
workshop position paper, 5th ACM 
Conf. Embedded Networked Sensor 
Systems, 2007, www.cs.berkeley.
edu/~honicky/sensys07.pdf).
This data could be integrated with 
information from location-tracking, 
geopositioning, and other sensing 
sources to, for example, determine 
air pollution levels for every block 
of every city, each consumer good’s 
complete transportation costs, and 
accurate measurements of individual 
and societal carbon footprints.
G
lobal climate change is one of 
the most pressing problems of 
our time. Government agen-
cies, universities, and businesses 
are starting to step up and invest 
in research, but even more change 
is needed, ranging from standards 
and policies to research innovations 
and new businesses. Now is the time 
for computer scientists to use their 
skills and resources to help create an 
energy-efficient future. n
