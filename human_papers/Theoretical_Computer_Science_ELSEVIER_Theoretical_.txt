Abstract 
The paper deals with on-line routing in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical 
networks. A sequence of requests arrives over time, each is a pair of nodes to be connected by a 
path. The problem is to assign a wavelength and a path to each pair, so that no two paths sharing 
a link are assigned the same wavelength. The goal is to minimize the number of wavelengths 
used to establish all connections. Raghavan and Upfal (Proc. 26th Annual Symp. on Theory 
of Computing, 1994, pp. 133-143) considered the off-line version of the problem, which was 
further studied in Aumann and Rabani (Proc. 6th ACM-SIAM Symp. on Discrete Algorithms, 
1995, pp. 567-576), Kaklamanis and Persiano (Proc. 4th Annual European Symp. on Algorithms, 
Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 1136, Springer, Berlin, 1996, pp. 460-470), Mihail et 
al. (Proc. 36th IEEE Annual Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science, 1995, pp. 548-557), 
Rabani, (Proc. 37th Annual Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science, 1996, pp. 400-409). 
For a line topology, the problem is the well-studied interval graph coloring problem. On-line 
algorithms for this problem have been analyzed in Kierstead and Trotter (Congr. Numer. 33 
(1981) 143-153). We consider trees, trees of rings, and meshes topologies, previously studied 
in the off-line case. We give on-line algorithms with competitive ratio O(logn) for all these 
topologies. We give a matching f~(logn) lower bound for meshes. We also prove that any 
algorithm for trees cannot have competitive ratio better than f~(log n/log log n). We also consider 
the problem where every edge is associated with parallel links. While in WDM technology, a fiber 
link requires different wavelengths for every transmission, space division multiplexing technology 
allows parallel links for a single wavelength, at an additional cost. Thus, it may be beneficial in 
terms of network economics to combine between the two technologies (this is indeed done in

1. Introduction 
All-optical networks promise data transmission rates several orders of magnitude 
higher than current networks. The high speeds in these networks arise from maintain- 
ing signals in optical form throughout a transmission thereby avoiding the overhead 
of conversions to and from electrical form (see [14] for an overview of the topic). 
Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) supports the propagation of multiple laser 
beams of distinct wavelengths through an optic fiber. Thus, the high bandwidth of the 
WDM network is utilized by partitioning it in many "channels", each at a different 
optical wavelength. Intuitively, we may think of wavelengths as light rays of different 
colors. 
A major algorithmic problem for optical networks is that of routing. Each routing 
request consists of a pair of nodes in the network, and requires the assignment of 
a path and a wavelength (color). The key restriction is that two requests with equal 
wavelength cannot be routed through the same link. The main goal is to minimize the 
number of wavelengths for certain routing requests. 
Many of the applications for high speed optical networks are real-time. It is therefore 
very natural to consider the problem of routing in an on-line setting where routing 
requests appear over time. 
1.1. The path coloring Problem 
The routing problem on a WDM network with generalized switches is referred to as 
path coloring. More formally, let G----(V,E) be a graph representing the network, with 
[V[ =n. We are given a sequence of routing requests consisting of pairs Pi =(si, ti) 
of nodes in G. The algorithm must assign a path connecting si and ti and a color, 
so that no two paths sharing an edge are assigned the same color. The goal is to 
minimize the number of colors. The performance measure for an on-line algorithm is 
the competitive ratio [29] defined as the worst-case ratio over all request sequences 
between the number of colors used by the on-line algorithm and the optimal number 
of colors necessary on the same sequence. 
While in WDM technology, a fiber link requires different wavelengths for every 
transmission, space division multiplexing (SDM) technology allows parallel links for 
a single wavelength, at an additional cost. This can be profitable since only a lim- 
ited number of wavelengths are available in practice. The two technologies are then 
combined to find an efficient trade off between the two approaches. This motivates 
considering a generalization of the path coloring problem where a link of a color is

21 
replaced with a number of parallel links. We will alternatively model this case with a 
bandwidth B available on a link for any color, meaning that B paths of the same color 
may be routed through a link (that is in the basic path coloring problem B = 1 ). 
1.1.1. Related previous work 
The off-line path coloring problem has been studied by Raghavan and Upfal [27] who 
give constant approximation algorithms for undirected trees and trees of rings. Further 
results for trees were given in a sequence of papers [16, 21, 23, 17]. Rings have been 
recently addressed in [12] and meshes were studied in [3, 20, 27]. Kleinberg and Tardos 
[20] give an O(log n) approximation algorithm for meshes and certain "nearly Eulerian 
planar graphs". Rabani [26] improves the bound for meshes to O(poly(log log n)). 
The on-line path coloring problem has been studied in the case of a line topology 
in the context of interval graph coloring by Kierstead and Trotter [19]. They give an 
optimal 3-competitive algorithm for the line [19]. Slusarek [28] proved the same bound 
for circular arc graphs. 
The path coloring problem is closely related to the virtual circuit routing problem, 
motivated by its application to ATM networks. The load version of this problem is 
where every requested pair must be assigned a path as to minimize the maximum 
number of paths crossing a given edge. Aspnes et al. [2] give an O(log n) competitive 
algorithm for the load version. Most of the work has concentrated on the throughput 
version of the problem, where every requested pair may be either accepted or rejected. 
The basic problem, also referred to as call-control, is where the paths of all accepted 
pairs must be edge-disjoint. This can also be generalized to the case where edges may 
have a given bandwidth B (that can be viewed as having B parallel edges). Awerbuch 
et al. [5] prove that if B= Q(log n) then there is an O(log n) competitive algorithm 
(for throughput). They also give a lower bound of Q(n) for deterministic algorithms 
in the general case. Randomized algorithms have been first studied by Awerbuch et 
al. [6, 7] giving an O(log A) competitive algorithm for trees, where A is the diameter 
of the tree. They also show a matching lower bound. Kleinberg and Yardos [20] give 
O(log n) competitive algorithms for meshes (and some generalization), improving upon 
a previous result of [7]. 
Bartal et al. [10] prove that for various routing problems including the throughput 
version of virtual circuit routing and the path coloring problem there exist networks 
where the competitive ratio is f~(n ~) (for some fixed e) for any randomized algorithm. 
Finally, the on-line version of maximizing the throughput in optical networks was 
addressed in [4]. 
1.1.2. Contributions of this paper 
We consider the on-line path coloring problem on trees, trees of rings, and meshes 
topologies: 
• We present an O(log n) competitive deterministic algorithm for path coloring on 
meshes.

We prove a matching 
R(log n) lower bound for the mesh. The lower bound holds 
for randomized 
algorithms 
for the load version 
of the virtual circuit problem which 
immediately 
extends to the path coloring 
problem. 
We comment 
that this also provides 
the first lower bound for the load version of 
the virtual circuit routing problem 
in undirected 
networks 
with unit edge capacities 
PI. 
We give an O(log n) competitive 
algorithm 
for path coloring on arbitrury 
networks 
with bandwidth 
R(log n) (the actual statement 
is somewhat 
more general). 
This 
algorithm 
is also used as a building 
block for our algorithm 
for path coloring 
on 
meshes. This result can be viewed as a balanced 
combination 
of WDM and SDM 
technologies. 
We give an O(log n) competitive 
algorithm 
for trees and trees oj’rings. 
We also 
prove that any deterministic 
algorithm 
for trees cannot have competitive 
ratio better 
than Q(log n/log log n) (even for trees with d = O(log n)). A logarithmic 
upper 
bound and an a(s) 
lower bound for trees have been independently 
obtained 
by Borodin, 
Kleinberg, 
and Sudan [I I]. 
1.1.3. Puper structure 
Section 
2 contains 
the results for path coloring 
with more bandwidth 
on arbitrary 
networks, 
that are also used in Section 
3 for the O(log n) competitive 
algorithm 
for 
path coloring 
on meshes. Section 4 contains 
the lower bound for meshes. Upper and 
lower bounds for trees are in Section 5. 
2. Path coloring with more bandwidth 
Let G = (V, E) be a network with 1 Y/ = n vertices and lEl = m edges. We consider 
the puth coloring problem 
with bandwidth 
B on the edges. At the jth step, call j, with 
endpoints 
(sj, Q), is presented 
to the algorithm 
that must assign a color c(j) 
and a path 
P(j). 
The goal of the on-line 
algorithm 
is to use a set of colors of cardinality 
at most 
C under the constraint 
that the bandwidth 
on any edge does not exceed B. 
We give an algorithm 
for general networks 
for this problem. 
The algorithm 
fixes a 
set % of C colors that it may choose from, at the beginning, 
based on an estimate 
for the optimal 
performance. 
The basic algorithm 
chooses, 
at every step, one path 
connecting 
the endpoints 
of the current 
call and one of the colors in Q? according 
to some optimization 
criterion. 
This criterion 
assigns 
to any edge of any color an 
exponential 
function 
of the current load. Our goal is to prove that the algorithm 
never 
exceeds a certain bandwidth 
on every edge. 
A variant 
for this algorithm 
proves to be useful 
(see Section 
3) in obtaining 
an 
algorithm 
for path coloring 
on meshes (with edge bandwidth 
= 1). 
In this variant we restrict the choice of the on-line 
algorithm 
for call j to a subset 
s(j) 
of % (that may be chosen according 
to some arbitrary rule) whose cardinality 
is 
at most cK.

We thus state our results in terms of this parameter ~. However, for the scope of 
this section alone one can focus the attention to the case where ~ = 1. 
Let B* be the bandwidth used by an offtine algorithm on any of C* colors to 
accomodate the whole set of calls in the sequence. 
We compare our algorithm to a stronger adversary that uses a bandwidth A* ~<B*C* 
on a single color, rather than being restricted to using C* colors and bandwidth B* 
for every color. 
We assume that the on-line algorithm knows a value A such that A* ~< A ~< 2A*. This 
is performed by applying a doubling technique that results in increasing the competitive 
ratio at most by a factor of 4. 
Let the load on edge e for color c, denoted by J~e(J),~c 
• 
be the number of calls 
assigned color c and a path crossing edge e when call j is presented. For a parameter 
[~ > 0, let a=ff. 
Call j is assigned a color c(j) and a path P(j) which achieve 
the minimum, over all the colors in c£(j) and all paths connecting sj and tj, of the 
following "exponential cost": 
Z 
aJ~lJ)(J)" 
e E P(j) 
Theorem 1. If the number of colors used by the algorithm is C=2A(1/~)(2/~ - 1) 
where A>~A* then the bandwidth is B<<,I + (1/fl)log(2m/~). 
Proof. Let 2 be the maximum load on any edge for any color in the solution of the 
on-line algorithm at the end of the sequence. Thus there exists an edge such that 
calls are assigned a path crossing it and with the same color. When the last such path 
P(k) is assigned to a call k, its exponential cost is at least a ~-l. By definition of the 
algorithm, the chosen path is the minimum cost path over all paths and colors in Cg(k). 
Therefore, at the time this call arrived, for ICg(k)l ~>ctC colors, any path connecting 
the same pair of vertices has a cost of at least a ~-1. Let Z(j) denote the sum of the 
exponential costs over all edges and all colors at step j. That is 
Z(j) = ~ 
~ a )'~(j). 
cCC~eCE 
Then it follows that 
Z(f) >1 ~Ca ~-1, 
(1) 
where X(f) indicates the value of a function X after the last step in the sequence. 
Let l*(j) be the number of calls in the adversary solution assigned path crossing 
edge e when call j is presented. 
We use the following potential function: 
( 
q~(J) = cc~eCEE E a2C(J) 1

24 
Y. Bartal, S. Leonardi/Theoretical Computer Science 221 (1999) 19-39 
The sum of the exponential costs of the on-line algorithm at the end of the sequence 
is also bounded by the following: 
Z(f) = E 
E aX<e(f) 
cE~ eEE 
( 
<~ 2 E E a'~;(f) 1

,,# 
cE<'6eEE 
~< 2(@(f) - @(0)) + 2mC, 
(2) 
where the first inequality follows since A >>.A*>~ l*(f). 
In the following we prove that for the claimed choice of C, the potential function 
does not increase after each step of the algorithm. Therefore, ~(f)~<~(0), and thus 
Eq. (1) and (2) can be combined to achieve 
1 
2m 
B~<;~I + ~ log--. 
To complete the proof we prove that if C=2A(1/oO(ff - 1) then for every j, 
• (j + 1)- ~(j)~<O. Let P*(j) be the path assigned by the adversary for call j. The 
change in the potential function due to call j is

since the load on an edge is nondecreasing and for eCP*(j) we have l*(j + 1)=

Observe that for any color c E cg(j), the cost of any path P connecting sj to tj is 
not less than the cost of the path P(j) on color c(j) chosen by the on-line algorithm 
for call j. Therefore, we get for any c E c~(j):

Recall that a = ft. Thus, by choosing C = 2A(l/a)(ff - 1) we have that the potential

[] 
We have assumed in the analysis that the algorithm knows a value A such that 
A* ~<A ~<2A*. In the following, we explain how to deal with this assumption. 
We start running a copy of the algorithm with A-- 1. If the algorithm is going to 
increase the load over B on some edge, then we run a new copy of the algorithm 
Y. Bartal, S. Leonardi/ Theoretical Computer Science 221 (1999) 19-39 
25 
with value of A doubled. Once A* ~<A ~<2A*, it follows from Theorem 2 that the load 
on any edge does not exceed B. In that case the number of colors used is at most 
C = 2A(1/~)(ff - 1 ) ~< 4A*(1/c0(ff - 1 ). 
Every time a new copy of the algorithm is run, a completely new set of colors is 
used. Observe that the cardinality of the set of colors is doubled with respect to the 
cardinality of the set of colors of the previous run of the algorithm. Therefore, the 
number of colors used by the algorithm is at most two times the number of colors 
used in the last run of the algorithm. 
Hence we get the following theorem: 
Theorem 2. The number of colors used by the algorithm is C <<.8A*(1/~)(ff - 1) and 
the bandwidth is B<<.I + (1/~)log(2m/c O. 
As an application we get the following result for the on-line load balancing problem 
[2], in which only one color is available and the goal is to minimize the number of 
paths assigned to a single edge of the network. 
By applying Theorem 2 with fl = 1 and c~-- 1 we get the following. 
Corollary 3. There exists an algorithm for on-line load balanc&g that uses O(A*) 
colors with bandwidth O(log n). 
Note that Corollary 3 gives a stronger result than that of [2] that only shows that 
the on-line load is bounded by O(A* log n). 
Finally, going back to the path coloring problem, recall that A* <<.C'B*. We can 
reformulate Theorem 2 to obtain the following (by choosing /~ = 2/76 where ? and 6 
are defined below). 
Corollary 4. Let 6 be such that B* = 6 log(2m/~), and let y be some positive coeffi- 
cient (satisfying ?B* ~>2). The algorithm for on-line path coloring with more band- 
width uses C <.% 8C* ( 6/c 0 log( 2m/~ )( 22/~'6 - 1 ) colors with bandwidth B <.% yB*, 
The above corollary shows that if the bandwidth is f~(log n), then the on-line algo- 
rithm does not exceed the bandwidth by using O(log n) more colors. We thus obtain 
the result for optical networks with general topology when the technologies WDM and 
SDM are combined in a network that contains f~(log n) parallel fiber optic links on 
each connection. 
3. Path coloring on meshes 
In this section we present an O(log n) competitive algorithm for path coloring on 
meshes. 
G=(V,E) denotes the v ~ × v ~ two-dimensional mesh. We consider v ~ to be a 
power of 2. Let IEI =m be the number of edges of the mesh. The vertex of the mesh 
26 
Y. Bartal, S. Leonardil Theoretical Computer Science 221 (1999) 19~9 
with row i and column j is denoted with G[i,j]. Given two vertices v = G[i,j], vZ= 
G[i',j'] we denote by d(v, v') = l i- i'1+ IJ-Jtl the length of the shortest path connecting 
v and v t. 
Calls are divided into short calls and long calls. Let ~ and tr be parameters that will 
be fixed later. They will satisfy the condition that tr log(2m/~) is a power 
of two. A call (s,t) is long if d(s,t) > 
2¢r log(2m/~), and short if d(s,t)<~2a 
log(2m/cQ. 
We use two different algorithms for long calls and short calls. A different set of colors 
will be used for long calls and short calls. The algorithm for long calls translates the 
problem in a mesh, to a problem of coloring with more bandwidth in a simulated 
network that is also a mesh. Theorem 2 allows a logarithmic competitive ratio with 
a logarithmic bandwidth on any edge. The route obtained in the simulated network is 
later translated into a route in the original mesh, satisfying the constraint that paths 
associated to calls with the same color are disjoint. We describe in Section 3.1 the 
construction of the simulated network, and in Section 3.2 how a route in the simulated 
network is transformed into a route in the original mesh. 
The algorithm for short calls classifies the calls on the basis of their length, and 
applies a greedy algorithm within each class. We present the algorithm for short calls 
in Section 3.3. 
Both algorithms for long and short calls have competitive ratio O(log n). Therefore, 
we can state the following theorem. 
Theorem 5. There exists an O(log n) competitive algorithm for path coloring on 
meshes. 
3.1. The construction of the simulated network 
In this section we describe the algorithm for coloring and routing long calls. 
We transform this problem into a problem on a simulated network of a mesh of size 
x v ~, with logarithmic bandwidth on the edges. 
The algorithm divides the mesh into [v~/(a log(2m/~))] x [x/~/(tr log(2m/cQ)] 
squares 
of size 
tr log(2m/~) x ¢r log(2m/7). 
Square 
Sip, q], 
p,q= 1 ..... x/n/ 
[o log(2m/~)], is the subgraph of G induced by the set of vertices {G[i,j]li= (p - 
1 )a log(2m/c¢)+ 1,..., per log(2m/~);j = (q- 1 )a log(2m/~)+ 1 ..... qa log(2m/~)}. 
Long calls have their endpoints in different squares, since the distance between the 
endpoints is bigger than 2G log(2m/7). 
The simulated network N 
of the 
mesh 
G=(V,E) 
is 
a 
mesh 
of size 
[x/~/(cr log(Zm/cQ)] x [x/~/(cr log(Zm/~))]. 
Let m p be the number of edges of the simulated network. Every edge of N is asso- 
ciated with a bandwidth equal to a log(2m/~)= 6 log(2m//~). (Observe that log m/= 
log m - O(log log m). Hence a ~ 6 for large m.) 
This mesh corresponds to the network obtained from the original mesh by rep- 
resenting every square of G with a vertex and connecting every pair of vertices

representing adjacent squares with an edge. The bandwidth of the edges models the 
fact that at most cr log(2m/c 0 edge-disjoint paths can be routed between two adjacent 
squares. 
The basic idea is to color and route long calls in the simulated network using the 
algorithm of Section 2 for path coloring with more bandwidth, and then translate the 
assigned paths into an appropriate routing in the original network. 
The sequence of long calls in the mesh G is transformed into a sequence of calls 
in the simulated network in the most natural way: Each long call (s,t) is replaced 
by a call between the two vertices of N representing the two squares containing s 
and t. 
The path obtained for a call in the simulated network is transformed into a path in 
the original mesh G respecting the following rule: The path in G will cross between 
adjacent squares in G where the path in N passes through the edge connecting the 
corresponding nodes in N. 
However, we need that the paths with same color crossing any square are edge- 
disjoint. For this purpose we will restrict the set of candidate colors for each call to 
a constant fraction of the overall number of colors. (Observe that the design of the 
algorithm of Section 3.2 includes this feature.) 
For this purpose we distinguish between the two squares that include the endpoints 
of a call, and the squares that are crossed by the path connecting the endpoints. 
We say that a call is internal to a square if one of its endpoints belongs to the 
square. A call is called external to a square if it is not internal to the square and 
the 
path 
derived 
by 
the 
routing 
in 
the 
simulated 
network 
crosses 
the 
square. 
We furthermore define in any square S of the mesh, three concentric regions: S l, 
S 2 and S 3 (see Fig. 1). Each region contains 2 log(2m//~) concentric rings of the 
square. S ~ is the most external region, S 2 is internal to S 1 and S 3 is internal to both 
S l and S 2. Finally, the area surrounded by S 3 is called the central region of the 
square. 
The set of colors ~ used by the on-line algorithm is partitioned into three sets 
c~1,c6~'2,C~3 of equal size. We impose a set of constraints on the color assignment 
and the routing strategy. These constraints help in avoiding intersection between paths 
associated with calls assigned the same color. 
1. If a call is assigned a color c ¢ cgi, i = 1,2, 3, then its two endpoints must lie on a 
region different from S i. 
28 
Y. Bartal, S. Leonardi/ Theoretical Computer Science 221 (1999) 19-39 
2. The path assigned to a call with color c E C i, i = 1, 2, 3, will cross any square of the 
mesh not containing an endpoint of the call using a ring of region S i. 
3. For any square, at most one internal call is assigned a given color. 
Consider the jth long call (sj, tj). Let S(sj) and S(tj) be the squares containing sj 
and tj, respectively. The algorithm of Section 2 asks for each call to define a set of 
candidate colors. The set cg(j) of candidate colors for call j is defined as follows. 
A color c C (~i is in oK(j) if the two following conditions hold: 
1. sj ~ Si(sj) and tj q~ Si(tj), i.e. both endpoints are not in region i of their correspond- 
ing squares. 
2. No call with an endpoint in S(sj) or S(tj) has been previously assigned color c. 
The algorithm for path coloring with more bandwidth in the simulated network is 
run with parameters satisfying: ~< ~; c5>~ 13; and y = 1/6. The value a that defines the 
size of each square is chosen in order to satisfy ~ log(2m/~)--6 log(2m'/~). 
The choice of the parameters is such that the adversary bandwidth B* = 6 log(2mt/~) 
is equal to the maximum number of calls that can be routed through two adjacent 
squares, and the width 6 log(2m//~) of a square is equal to 13 times the maximum 
bandwidth B = log(2ml/~) used by the on-line algorithm for routing between two ad- 
jacent squares. 
To apply the result of Corollary 4 we need the following lemma. 
Lemma 6. The set of feasible colors cg(j) for a call (sj, tj) has size at least ~C. 
Proof. If the endpoints sj, tj belong to two differently indexed regions (for instance 
sjESl(sj) and tjES3(tj)) then one of sets C i, i= 1,2,3, meets Condition 1, that is 
both endpoints of the call are outside region S i. 
If the endpoints belong to the same indexed region or at least one of them is in the 
central region, then at least two sets among C l, C 2, C 3 satisfy Condition 1. 
1 of the colors satisfy Condition 1. 
Thus we conclude that in all cases, at least 
Let us compute which fraction of these colors satisfy Condition 2 as well, that is no 
call, internal to the square, has been previously assigned the color. 
For this purpose we observe that if the optimal number of colors is C* then the max- 
imum number of calls internal to a specific square is bounded by C*126 log(2m'/~). 
Thus the maximum number of calls internal to one of the two squares containing sj 
and tj is I<<.86C* log(2mt/~). 
Recall that the set of colors used in one run of the algorithm is at most C = 4C*(6/~) 
(log(2m'/~) + 1). Thus I~< 32-~C. 
Therefore, the set of colors that can be used for a given call has size at least 
I (I)1 
}~C>~C, 
for a ~< ~, thus proving the claim. 
[] 
From Corollary 4 we then derive the following corollary, that bounds the number of 
colors and the bandwidth used by the on-line algorithm for path coloring with more 
bandwidth in the simulated network.

Corollary 7. The algorithm for on-line path coloring with more bandwidth in the 
simulated network N uses C=24C*(~/~)log(2ml/~) colors with bandwidth B <~ log 
(2m'/~). 
3.2. Routing of long calls 
In this section we describe how to transform a path in the simulated network N 
into a path in the mesh G, so that the paths associated to calls with same color 
are mutually edge-disjoint. Each call is assigned a path in the simulated network. 
This path indicates the squares in the original mesh to cross to connect the two end- 
points of a call. We are left to describe the route followed by the path within each 
square. 
The run of the algorithm for path coloring with more bandwidth ensures that 
the maximum bandwidth of the on-line algorithm in the simulated network is B = 
(~/13) log(2m/~). It follows that at most B calls are assigned paths crossing the bound- 
ary between two adjacent squares, and then at most 2B external calls cross each square. 
We will maintain inductively the following property: A call crosses the boundary 
between two squares on a row or on a column connecting the central regions of the 
two squares. The central region of a square has size B x B. Since B is the maximum 
number of calls routed between adjacent squares, a distinct row or column can be 
associated with any call. 
We first consider external calls. By induction, each external call enters the square 
on a row or on a column leading to the central area. We route it towards the central 
area until a free ring of region S i is reached. This is always the case since there are at 
most 2B external calls and 2B available rings in each region S i. The call then follows 
the ring until it reaches a free row or a free column connecting the central region of 
the square to the central region of the adjacent square to which the call is directed. 
The route follows such row or such column until the adjacent square. 
Finally, we consider the routing of the possible single internal call. The endpoint of 
the internal call is outside the area S i. If it is originated in the central area, then it 
can follow any path within the central area until it reaches a free row or column that 
connects to the central area of the adjacent square to which the internal call is directed. 
The route goes through such row or column until the adjacent square is reached. If the 
endpoint of the internal call is outside the central area and outside region S i, then the 
call is routed through the ring that contains the endpoint, until a free row or column 
connecting to the central area of the adjacent square to which the call is directed 
is met. This row or column is followed until the border of the appropriate adjacent 
square. 
The routing of a call assigned a color of set cg: is shown in Fig. 2. The figure 
describes the route followed in the two squares where the call is internal, and in one 
square where the call is external. The call has one endpoint in a region S 3 and one 
endpoint in a region S I. The call is routed on a ring of region S 2 in all the squares 
where it is external.

3.3. Coloring short calls 
In this section we consider the routing and coloring of short calls. We remind that 
a call (u,v) is short if d(u,v)<~L = 2tr log(2m/~). 
We define a partition of level l of the mesh, for each l -- 1 ..... log L, as follows. 
The mesh is divided into x/~/21 x x/~/21 squares of size 2 t x 2 t. Each square Sip, q], 
p,q = 1 ..... x/~/2 l, is the subgraph of G = (V,E) induced by the set of vertices 
{G[i,j]li = (p- 
1)21 + 1 ..... p2/; j = (q- 1)2 z + 1 ..... q21}. 
We define the set cgz of calls of level l as those calls that have the two endpoints 
within the same square in any partition of level higher than 1, but in two different 
squares of level l. The level of a call is log L if the two endpoints are in different 
squares of the partition of level log L. 
The algorithm uses a distinct set of colors for each set ~t. The routing assignment 
for a call (u, v) will always follow a shortest path from u to v. Each color is denoted 
by a positive integer. The color selected for a call (u,v) of level l is that one of 
minimum integer value such that there exists a path of minimum length connecting u 
to v, with this color available on all the edges of the path. 
Theorem 8. The algorithm for on-line coloring of short calls is O(log n)-competitive. 
Proof. Let ONt and OPT/, be the number of colors used by the on-line algorithm 
and by the optimal off-line algorithm respectively, for calls of set I. Let Ct be the 
maximum number of calls that have both endpoints within the same square of level 
l + 1, but in different squares of level l. Clearly, ON1 <~Ct. 
Let us consider the optimal number of colors for a set of calls of level l with both 
endpoints within the same square of level I + 1. Each of these calls is routed either 
through the border of the square of level l + 1, or through the border separating two of 
the four squares of level l contained in the square of level 1 + 1. Since the size of the 
border of the square of level l ÷ 1 is 4 × 2 l+l and the size of the borders separating 
the four squares of level 1 is 4 × 2 l, then at most 6 - 2 l+1 calls of level l with both 
endpoints in the same square of level l ÷ 1 can be assigned the same color. Therefore, 
the number of colors required by the optimal solution for calls of level I is at least 
OPTz >~ Ct/6

4. Lower bounds on meshes 
In this section we present a randomized lower bound of ~2(log n) for the path coloring 
problem on meshes. The lower bound also applies to the load balancing problem on 
meshes, where we seek for minimizing the maximum number of paths crossing a link, 
irrespective of the color [2]. 
The lower bound is based on an application of Yao's Lemma to on-line algorithms 
[30]. We construct a distribution over request sequences, such that the number of colors 
used by an optimal algorithm is always bounded by a constant, while the expected on- 
line load (i.e., the maximum number of paths crossing an edge) of a deterministic 
algorithm is f2(log n). We recall that the load of a path coloring algorithm is bounded 
above by the number of colors and thus the lower bound follows. 
Consider a N × N 2-dimensional mesh, with N = v/-n. The distribution over request 
sequences is defined recursively in L = log 4 N stages as follows. At the ith stage of 
the recursion, i = 1,2 ..... L, we define a probability distribution for an 4 L-i+I × 4 L-i÷I 
square S/ of the mesh. We consider a partition of 5',. into 16 subsquares of size 4 L-i × 
4 L-i. The internal part of the square S,. is defined as the square I consisting of the 4 
internal subsquares in the above partition. Si\l is called the external part of the square. 
Let I[x, y] denote the vertex with row x and column y in the submesh defined by 1 
where O<~x,y < 2.4 L-i. We now give for each 0~<y < 2-4 L-i a set of 12 vertical 
calls from I[0, y] to •[2-4 L-i- 1, y]. Then choose at random one of the 16 subsquares 
and proceed with the (i + 1)st stage of the probability distribution for that subsquare 
recursively. 
The next two claims give bounds on the optimal and the on-line solutions. 
Claim 9. The number of colors used by an optimal algorithm for the above proba- 
bility distribution is at most 12. 
Proof. We prove the claim by induction on i. If the subsquare of size 4 L-i × 4 L-i 
chosen in the probability distribution is not in the internal part I, then we route the 
calls given in the ith stage through the internal part of the square (see Fig. 3a), and 
otherwise we route the calls through the external part of the square (see Fig. 3b) so 
that none of the routes will cross the routes for calls in stages j > i. This can be 
done so that calls with distinct source and destination have disjoint paths and thus the 
number of colors is 12.

Fig. 3. The routing for the lower bound on meshes. 
Claim 10. Let Ai be the expected average load of the on-line algorithm on the edges 
in the square Si. Then Ai >~i. 
ProoL We first prove that the average increase in the load of the edges of the square 
S; due to the requests given at the ith stage is at least 1. The number of edges of the 
mesh Si is 2 x 4 L-i+I × (4 L-i+I -- 1). At the ith stage, 12 x 2 x 4 L-i calls are presented. 
Every call of stage i is connected on a path containing at least 2 x 4 L-i - 1 edges 
of Si (even if the path passes outside Si). The sum for every call of stage i of the 
number of edges of Si included in the call is then at least 2 x 4 L-i+I x (4 L-i+I - 1). 
This results into an increase of the average load on the edges of Si of at least 1. 
We now prove by induction that Ai >~ i. For i = 1 it follows from the above claim. 
We assume the claim holds for i and prove it for i + 1. Since the subsquare for the 
(i + 1)'st stage is chosen at random the expected average load of the edges of Si+] is 
equal to Ai. Since the average increase in the load of the edges of Si+] is at least 1 
we have Ai+l >1i + 1. [] 
We conclude the following. 
Theorem 11. The competitive ratio of any on-line randomized path coloring algorithm 
on meshes is f~(log n) against oblivious adversaries. The same lower bound holds for 
load balancing on meshes. 
5. Path coloring on trees and trees of rings 
In this section we consider the on-line path coloring problem on trees and on trees 
of rings. We give an algorithm with competitive ratio O(log n) for both trees and trees 
Y. Bartal, S. Leonardi/Theoretical Computer Science 221 (1999) 19 39 
33 
of rings, and prove an f~(log n~ log log n) deterministic lower bound on the competitive 
ratio of any algorithm on trees. We remark that the lower bound is achieved on a 
tree of diameter O(log n) (in contrast to the f~(log n) randomized lower bound for the 
call-control problem which is achieved on a tree of diameter n). 
5.1. An upper bound for path coloring on trees and trees of rings 
We show in this section how to obtain an on-line path coloring algorithm for trees. 
A simple modification of the algorithm also applies to trees of rings. 
A natural approach is to use an algorithm based on a First Fit strategy. Colors are 
indicated by positive integers. Every pair is assigned the minimum integer not assigned 
to an intersecting pair. 
The First Fit algorithm is proved to be O(logn) competitive if the number of pairs 
in the instance is polynomial in the number n of vertices of the tree. The problem is 
reduced to coloring a d-inductive graph. A graph is d-inductive if its vertices can be 
numbered in a way that each vertex has at most d links to vertices with higher number. 
Irani [15] gives an algorithm that colors on-line a d-inductive graph of n vertices with 
O(d log n) colors. 
The path coloring problem on trees corresponds to the problem of coloring an inter- 
section graph where each vertex represents a pair, and two vertices are connected if the 
two corresponding pairs are intersecting. Let C be the maximum number of paths that 
are connected through a given edge. C is a lower bound on the clique number of the 
intersection graph and then a lower bound on the chromatic number of the intersection 
graph. 
Lemma 12. The intersection graph of an instance of the path coloring problem on 
trees is 2(C- 1)-inductive, where C is the clique number of the intersection graph. 
Proof. We show that we can number all pairs of vertices in a way that each pair is 
conflicting with at most 2(C- 1 ) pairs with higher number. 
The numbering is obtained by rooting the tree at any vertex, then ordering the pairs 
in a way that pair (s,t) precedes pair (st, if) only if LCA(st, ff) is not a descendant of 
LCA(s,t). This ordering can be easily produced by visiting the tree from the leaves 
to the root. It follows that a pair (s,t) can intersect a pair (s~,ff) with higher number 
only on one of the two edges of (s,t) that are adjacent to LCA(s,t). 
Since there are at most C- 1 pairs distinct from (s,t) intersecting on an edge of 
the tree, it follows that any pair can intersect at most 2(C- 1) pairs with higher 
number. 
[] 
Combining the above lemma with the result of [15], we obtain the following. 
Theorem 13. The algorithm First Fit is O(log n )-competitive for on-line path coloring 
on trees of n vertices, if the number of pairs is polynimially bounded in n. 
34 
Y. Bartal, S. Leonardi/Theoretical Computer Science 221 (1999) 19-39 
If the number of pairs is not bounded by a polynomial in n, we present an algorithm 
with competitive ratio O(log n) based on a variation of the First Fit strategy. A similar 
result has independently been obtained in [1]. 
All the vertices of the tree are partitioned into O(log n) different classes, by recur- 
sively finding a balanced tree separator. A balanced tree separator [22] is a vertex 
2 
whose removal splits the tree into pieces of at most ~n vertices. The tree separator 
of the original tree is assigned level O. Removing the level-0 node splits the tree into 
subtrees of level 1. In general, the tree separators of the level-j trees are assigned 
level j and removing them creates subtrees of level j + 1. After a logarithmic number 
of recursions the trees obtained are single vertices and the procedure stops. A similar 
technique is also used in [6] for the online call-control problem on trees. 
The classification of the calls is done as follows. Every edge is assigned the lowest 
of the levels associated with its two endpoints. Every call is assigned the class indicated 
by the lowest level of an edge included in the call. 
Every time a new pair is presented, the algorithm assigns the color with minimum 
integer value that is not assigned to any intersecting call of the same level or to any 
call of other level. 
Theorem 14. The algorithm Jbr on-line path coloring on a tree of n vertices is 
O(log n )-competitive. 
Proof. Let Cl ~< C be the maximum number of calls including the same edge of level 
l. For every class l, we clearly have that Ct is a lower bound on the optimal solution. 
The proof uses the two following facts: 
(i) Every call of level l contains at most one vertex of level l; 
(ii) If two calls of level l intersect, then they cross an identical edge of level I. 
Both facts are easily proved observing that otherwise a call of level 1 would include 
a vertex of level 1 - 1, a contradiction to level l being the minimal level of an edge 
included in the call. 
A call of level l intersects at most 2(Cl - 1 ) calls of level l. Therefore, the maximum 
number of colors used by the greedy algorithm for calls of level l is bounded by 
2Ct - 1. Calls of distinct levels are assigned disjoint sets of colors, thus implying that 
at most O(logn)(2C- 1) colors are used by the algorithm for the whole sequence 
of calls. 
[] 
For trees of rings we apply the same algorithm after using the idea [16,27] of 
removing one edge in every ring, thus obtaining a tree. Since the maximum num- 
ber of calls that cross an edge of the obtained tree is at most twice the maxi- 
mum number of calls that cross an edge of the original tree of rings, we obtain the 
following. 
Theorem 15. The algorithm for on-line path coloring on trees of rings of n vertices 
is O(log n )-competitive.

5.2. A lower bound for path coloring on trees 
We prove that for any on-line p-competitive algorithm for path coloring on trees 
p = Q(log n~ log log n). 
The lower bound is established on a complete binary tree of L levels, where L is a 
power of 2. Level 0 denotes the root while level L - 1 denotes the leaves. The number 
of vertices at level l is 21, and the number of vertices in the tree is n = 2 L - 1. 
The input sequence for the lower bound is generated in stages. The optimal number 
of colors is 2 for the entire sequence. We will prove for any on-line algorithm that 
the number of necessary colors will increase by 1 at each stage. The sequence will be 
iterated for ~(L/logL) stages, thus obtaining the lower bound. 
At stage i of the sequence we will give a lower bound on the number of existing 
disjoint paths from a vertex of a level 7i to a leaf, such that for each color in a specific 
set of i colors there exists an edge in the path that is included in a call assigned this 
color. 
More precisely, we maintain the following invariant at the end of any stage i ~> 0 of 
the sequence. 
There exists a set Ci of i colors, a level li, li ~7i <<.L - 1 - i, where l~ = L - 
1 -ilog8pL, such that there are at least pg = 2L-l/(8pL)i pairs of paths with the 
following properties: 
1. Each pair is formed by two paths from two leaves to their least common ancestor 
(LCA) at level li. 
2. Each vertex of level li is the LCA of at most one pair of paths. 
3. For any path and for any color c E Ci, there is one edge in the path included in a 
call with color c. 
4. Any edge of a path is included in at most one call. 
The invariant is maintained in the following way: the basis case of our construction 
is as follows. At stage 0, 7o = l0 = L- 1, and Co = 9. We associate a set of P0 = 2 L- 
pairs of empty paths, two with each leaf, with both endpoints equal to the leaf itself. 
No calls are presented. Hence, all four properties trivially hold. 
At stage i + 1, p~ new calls are presented, one for each pair of paths. Let ul, u2 be 
the two leaves that are endpoints of the two paths of a pair, and let LCA(ul, u2) be 
the LCA at level li of these two leaves. Let v be the direct ancestor of LCA(ul,u2). 
For any pair of paths we present a call having as endpoints one of the two leaves 
(arbitrarily chosen), say u~, and v. 
The on-line algorithm cannot use colors of Ci for these calls. We will show that the 
optimal number of colors at any stage of the sequence is at most 2. Hence, in order 
for the on-line algorithm to be p-competitive, it must use less than 2p colors for this 
set of calls. 
Therefore, there must be a set of calls Si of cardinality at least pi/2p assigned the 
same color. Call this color ci+ 1. Let C~+1 = Ci[.-J{Ci+l }. In the following we concentrate 
on this set of calls. 
We first show a set of paths that satisfy conditions 3 and 4. 
36 
Y. Bartal, S. Leonardil Theoretical Computer Science 221 (1999) 19-39 
Each call in Si is from a leaf ul to a node v. This is constructed from some level i 
pair of paths from leaves ul and u2 to LCA(ul, u2), which is a child of v. For any pair 
only one call in Si is constructed. Therefore, for any call in Si, conditions 3 and 4 are 
satisfied at stage i + 1 for the path connecting the leaf u2 to v or any ancestor of v. In 
fact, at most one call includes any edge from u2 to LCA(ubu2) and any color c c Ci 
is associated with a call that crosses only one edge in the path, using the invariant 
for level i. Moreover, the edge from LCA(ul, u2) to v is associated with only one call 
with color Ci+l. 
We thus have a set of pi/2p paths satisfying conditions 3 and 4 of the invariant. 
We call this set of paths Pi+l. 
The level li+l is such that 2/~+'+1 <~pi/2p. We derive from Pi+l a new set P[+I as 
follows: we consider each path in Pi+l according to its ancestor in level li+l. If a 
vertex in level li+l is an ancestor of an odd number of paths we exclude one of these 
paths. Since the number of vertices of level li+l is at most ½Pi/2p, the cardinality of 
P~+I is at least lpi/2p. 
We now scan paths in P[+I from left to right, following the order of the leaves 
that are endpoints of those paths (we assume that there is some left-to-right order 
between the leaves, i.e., their order in a pre-order traversal). We associate each pair of 
successive leaves with their LCA, that is a vertex of level between li+ 1 and L - i - 1. 
We need the following simple property of binary trees. 
Lemma 16. Each vertex in a binary tree is the LCA of at most one pair of successive 
leaves. 
Proof. The LCA of two leaves in a binary tree is the only vertex with one leaf in the 
right subtree and the other leaf in the left subtree. Therefore, by contradiction, if two 
pairs of successive leaves have the same LCA, then both the right and the left subtree 
contain one leaf for both pairs. It follows that two leaves in a pair are not successive 
leaves in the order. 
[] 
Finally, let li+l be a level between L- 
i- 
1 and li+1, achieving the maximum 
cardinality set of pairs of successive paths that have LCA at that level. We define the 
set of pairs of paths for the stage i + 1 to be the set of pairs of successive paths that 
have LCA at level li+l. 
Since the number of levels is L, it follows that the number of pairs of paths at stage 
i + 1 is at least ¼Pi/2pL = 2C-l/(8pL) i+l = Pi+l. From the above construction, it 
follows that both conditions 1 and 2 hold for this set of pairs. 
The next lemma gives the size of the optimal solution on the input sequence. 
Lemma 17. The optimal solution uses at most 2 colors. 
Proof. Any edge is included in at most 2 calls of the input sequence, and all calls are 
directed from a leaf to an ancestor. We color calls in a top-to-bottom way. Consider 
Y. Bartal, S. Leonardi/ Theoretical Computer Science 221 (1999) 19-39 
37 
a vertex v and an edge e connecting v to a descendant. If no call including e has v as 
an endpoint, the claim holds. If a call including e has v as an endpoint, then we use 
for that call a color that is not used for the other call including e. Since an edge is 
included in at most two calls, the claim is proved. 
[] 
The following theorem states the lower bound for path coloring on trees. 
Theorem 18. Any algorithm for path colorin 9 on trees of n vertices has a competitive 
ratio of f~(log n~ log log n). 
Proof. The on-line algorithm uses at least i colors after i stages of the construction 
above. Hence, by Lemma 17 the competitive ratio is p >>. i/2. 
The lower bound is thus obtained by computing the maximum number of stages the 
sequence can be repeated. We iterate the sequence while li : 
L - 1 - i log 8pL ~ 1. 
Since p>>.i/2, at the end of the sequence we have that p>>.(L- 2)/2 log8pL. Since 
n = 2 L - 1, we obtain that p -- ~2(logn/loglogn). 
[] 
6. Conclusions 
In this paper we consider the on-line path coloring problem on trees and meshes 
topologies, motivated by its applications to Wavelength division multiplexing opti- 
cal networks. We also study general networks when a logarithmic number of par- 
allel 
links 
is 
available, 
thus 
modeling 
Space 
division 
multiplexing 
optical 
networks. 
We present deterministic algorithms with logarithmic competitive ratio. For meshes, 
we give a matching randomized lower bound. For trees topologies, it is not known if 
a randomized algorithm can achieve a better competitive ratio. This is not even known 
for a line network topology, where deterministic algorithms have competitive ratio 
of 3 [19]. 
The off-line approximation of these problems is also an interesting open problem. 
For meshes, recently Rabani has achieved a poly (loglogn) approximation [26]. For 
trees, when each link is formed by two directed links with opposite directions, an 
algorithm that uses a number of colors that is at most ] times the maximum number 
of paths crossing a link has recently been proposed [17]. There are no reasons to think 
that such bounds cannot be improved.
